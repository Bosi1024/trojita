    FIXME: would be cool to have more clear error messages

    Also perhaps provide a list of URLs of external entities? But note that
    the current implementation is an "all or nothing" -- once the user clicks
    the "allow external entities" button, they will be enabled for the current
    message until it is closed. Therefore, it is possible that user allows requests
    to a presumably "safe site", but something evil subsequently asks for something
    from a malicious, third-party site. I'm not sure how they'd do that, though, given
    that we already do disable JavaScript...
