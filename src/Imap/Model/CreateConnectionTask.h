Upon its construction, this class will obtain a connection to the specified
mailbox. If it subsequently emits the completed() slide, you can use its parser
argument as a handle to a parser pointing to a fully synchronized mailbox.

FIXME: this is actually still not true ATM, the mailbox might be left in a
semi-synchronized state. Will be fixed later.
