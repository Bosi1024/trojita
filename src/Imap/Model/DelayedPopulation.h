/** @short Helper for filing child mailboxes outside of MVC slots

There's a problem with TreeItemMailbox' handling of fetch(). The fetch() could easily get
called from something like rowCount(), and the attached proxy models or views or whatever
would get etremely confused when model emits and signals about new arrivals etc from inside
rowCount().

This class therefore acts as a safe wrapper delaying the actualy calls to beginInsertRows()
etc until the event loop is re-entered.

This is similar to former MailboxUpdater, except that that particular class was not safe with
regard to TreeItem lifetime. This one is.

This class will automatically delete itself when it's done. The intended usage is create-and-forget
like this:

    new DelayedAskForChildrenOfMailbox(model, mailbox);

public:
    DelayedAskForChildrenOfMailbox(Model *model, const QModelIndex &mailbox);

    /** @short Call Model's _askForChildrenOfMailbox() */
    void askNow();
private:
    /** @short The Model */
    Model *m_model;
    /** @short Mailbox which wants to have its children updated */
    QPersistentModelIndex m_mailbox;
    /** @short True if we're to ask for top-level mailboxes

    This is a special case because invalid parent means top-level mailbox. That could fool our
    logic of checking the persistent index for validity and could lead either to ignored requests
    or to infinite recursion.
