Slots which are connected to signals directly or indirectly connected to this Model could, unfortunately, re-enter the event
loop.  When this happens, other events could possibly get delivered leading to activation of Model's "dangerous" slots:

    - responseReceived()
    - slotParserDisconnected()
    - slotParseError()

These slots are dangerous because they have the potential of re-entering the event loop and also could delete the Parsers/Tasks.
Thhat's why we have to use a crude reference counter to guarantee that our objects aren't deleted on return from a nested event
loop until the slots triggered by the *outer* event loops have finished.

See https://projects.flaska.net/issues/467 for a tiny bit of detail.
