    /** @short List of pending or running tasks which require this mailbox

    There are four sorts of tasks:

    1) Those that require a synchronized mailbox connection and are already running
    2) Those that require such a connection but are not running yet
    3) Tasks which are going to replace this KeepMailboxOpenTask when it's done
    4) Tasks that do not need any particular mailbox

    If these sorts, 4) are not scheduled through the KeepMailboxOpenTask, and hence are not visible from this context at all.

    Sorts 2) and 3) have a common feature -- they are somehow "waiting" for their turn, so that they could get their job done.
    They will start when this KeepMailboxOpenTask asks them to.

    Finally, tasks of the first kind shall not be treated as "children of the KeepMailboxOpenTask", but shall be able to keep the
    KeepMailboxOpenTask from disappearing.

    An "active task" means that a task is receiving the server's responses.  An active task in this sense is always present in the
    corresponding ParserState's activeTasks list.  These tasks have their ImapTask::parentTask set to zero, because they are no
    longer waiting for their chance to run, they are running already.  They are also *not* included in any other task's
    dependentTasks -- simply because the sanity rule says that:

        (ImapTask::parentTask is non-zero) <=> (the parentTask::dependingTasks contains that task)

    This approach is also used for visualization of the task tree.

    This is the mapping of the task sorts into the places which keep track of them:

    * The 4) go straight to the ParserState::activeTasks and remain there until they terminate
    * The 3) gets added to the waitingKeepTasks *and* to the dependentTasks. They remain there until the time this
    KeepMailboxOpenTask terminates. At that time, the first of them gets activated while the others get prepended to the first
    task's waitingKeepTasks list.
    * The 2) are found in the dependentTasks
    * The 1) originally existed as 2), but got run at some time.  When they got run, they got also added to the
    ParserState::activeTasks, but vanished from this KeepMailboxOpenTask::dependentTasks.  However, to prevent this
    KeepMailboxOpenTask from disappearing, they are also kept in the runningTasksForThisMailbox list.
