The boom of mobile computing in the last few years has changed the way how people work with their e-mail.  After a short
period where it appeared that the web mail was the future and days of standard protocols were numbered, suddenly people
realized that there in fact {\em is} a merit in having a standardized protocol for e-mail access.

Contemporary smartphones started to smear down the border between how a text message, and instant-messaging (IM)
communication and a traditional e-mail work.  Suddenly, it is common to have a single ``messaging'' application
aggregating communication history gathered from many distinct channels.

Even though some people prefer not to use these integrated facilities, their mere existence and certain demand from the
end-users present an unique opportunity for standardization --- it is easier to develop, test and deploy {\em one}
particular data provider suitable for use with many different services from multitude of vendors than having to deploy a
custom implementation for each social network which happens to be popular this year and on the continent the device
manufacturer decided to target.  Engineers from cell phone and tablet vendors taking place in the IETF standardization
process are clear evidence that the market recognizes this potential and that nobody wants to loose.

In this thesis, I would like to explore the IMAP protocol \cite{rfc3501} and its rich extension family, evaluating their
features by a prism of a {\em mobile client} --- a device which might have a decent amount of CPU and memory resources,
as common with today's smartphones and modern tablets, but whose network connection is prone to frequent interruptions
and might be payed based on the amount of transferred data.  It turns out that although many of these extensions are
extremely useful for increased efficiency of a client's operation, there are still quite a few opportunities for
improvement.

The next chapter (p. \pageref{sec:imap-protocol}) of this thesis provides a brief introduction to the baseline IMAP
protocol, its strengths and weaknesses.  The third chapter (p. \pageref{sec:imap-extensions}) analyzes the existing IMAP
extensions based on the ``layer'' on which they add features to IMAP.  In chapter four (p.
\pageref{sec:proposed-extensions}, I have selected three completely different areas in which the IMAP status, as of
2012, can still be improved.  My improvements are delivered in the format of the so-called {\em Internet Drafts},
materials directly used by the IETF as the source of the RFC documents.

Chapter five (p. \pageref{sec:mobile-imap}) evaluates the status of the extension support among a selection of existing
mobile clients available on the market.  Chapter six describes a high-level overview of how my mobile e-mail
client {\em Trojitá} operates.

All of the extensions which I have proposed during my work on this thesis are available in their formal format from
appendix \ref{sec:id-manuscripts} (p. \pageref{sec:id-manuscripts}).

Finally, as Trojitá is an open-source project, appendix \ref{sec:acknowledgement} (p. \pageref{sec:acknowledgement})
acknowledges the work of other developers who have contributed to Trojitá over the years.  It also mentions two
companies which decided to build their e-mail products on top of Trojitá.
