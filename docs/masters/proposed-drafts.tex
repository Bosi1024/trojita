\chapter{Proposed Extensions}

Previous chapters have shed some light on the complicated world of IMAP and showed how the protocol limitations affects
the users' experience.  I have also introduced some of the existing extensions which aim to address many shortcomings.
There are still quite a few issues which make lives of the client implementors harder than necessary, though.  At this
point, I present three extensions which fix race conditions, improve the effectiveness of the protocol or add new
features which contribute to smoother operation of the e-mail clients.  This broad range of changes was selected to
illustrate that improving IMAP can happen on many different levels.

Internet Drafts are usually prepared in a special system \cite{rfc-formatting} which handles the required strict
document formatting using ASCII art.  This chapter is therefore purposely very short, providing only the minimal
descriptions of the proposed extensions.  The Internet Drafts themselves are found in appendix \ref{sec:id-manuscripts}
on page \pageref{sec:id-manuscripts} and are an integral part of this thesis.
