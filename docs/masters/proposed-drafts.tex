\chapter{Proposed Internet Drafts}

Previous chapters have shed some light on the complicated world of IMAP.  We have shown how its limitations have
affected the users' experience and introduced some of the existing extensions which aim to address some of the
shortcomings.  There are still quite a few issues which make lives of the client implementors harder than necessary.  At
this point we present three extensions which fix race conditions, improve the effectiveness of the protocol or add new
features which contribute to smoother operation of the e-mail clients.
