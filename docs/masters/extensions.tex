\chapter{IMAP Extensions}
\label{sec:imap-extensions}

\begin{abstract}
  Previous chapter has outlined the generic mode of operation of the IMAP protocol and provided an overview of what
  features are available.  In this chapter, we will talk about how to improve on the basic functionality through the
  optional extensions.
\end{abstract}

It might be concluded from the brief analysis presented in the previous chapter that a few feature of IMAP are rather
limiting in its real-world deployment.  Fortunately, the IMAP protocol includes built-in support of extensions which
allow rather substantial changes to the network communication.

\section{Optimizing the Protocol}

Before dwelling into more advanced topics like improving the synchronization performance or adding new features, let's
have a look at the basic layer of the IMAP protocol and investigate how these affect performance.

\subsection{The LITERAL+ Extension}
\label{sec:imap-literalplus}

One of the lowest-hanging optimization fruit to cater are IMAP's synchronizing literals.  In the basic IMAP, before a
clients proceeds with tasks involving upload of binary data (or any data over a certain size, for that matter), it has
to ask for an explicit server's approval based on the length of the data in question.  As we have shown previously, this
confirmation imposes a full round trip over the network, inducing latency and destroying any potential pipelining
improvements.

The LITERAL+ extension (RFC~2088~\cite{rfc2088}) simply lifts the requirement of having to wait for the server's
continuation requests by a subtle change of the syntax.  Adding an overhead of just one byte, the latency is completely
eliminated and communication gets rapidly streamlined.  We can go as far as to say that the code paths for dealing with
LITERAL+ data are actually simpler than having to deal with the old-fashioned synchronizing literals.  Consider the
following example:

\begin{minted}{text}
  S: * OK
  C: A001 LOGIN {11}
  # The client has to wait for server's response before proceeding any further
  S: + go ahead
  C: FRED FOOBAR {7}
  # A second round-trip wait occurs here
  S: + go ahead
  C: fat man
  S: A001 OK LOGIN completed
\end{minted}

When using the LITERAL+ syntax, the whole interaction happens without having to wait for the server:

\begin{minted}{text}
  S: * OK
  C: A001 LOGIN {11+}
  C: FRED FOOBAR {7+}
  C: fat man
  S: A001 OK LOGIN completed
\end{minted}

Trojit치 includes full support for the LITERAL+ extension -- when it detects the {\tt LITERAL+} capability, it will
immediately switch to using non-synchronizing literals for increased performance.

\subsection{Data Compression}

IMAP is a textual, line-based protocol.  As such, it presents extremely good opportunities for compression -- using the
tried DEFLATE algorithm~\cite{rfc1951}, the basic IMAP chatter can be easily compressed to 25~-~40~\% of its original
size~\cite[p. 4]{rfc4978}.

RFC~4978~\cite{rfc4978} provides mechanism for exactly this functionality through the {\tt COMPRESS=DEFLATE} capability.
Trojit치 ships with full support for this extension through the permissively licensed {\tt zlib} library.  Unfortunately,
the Qt's {\tt QSslSocket} currently doesn't provide a way to reliably tell whether the SSL connection is already
employing compression.  When combined with IMAP servers hidden behind SSL accelerators or load balancers (i.e. in
situations where the server does not have a clear idea whether the session is already compressed either), this has a
risk of needlessly trying to compress data twice.  This is a limitation in system libraries which cannot be overcome
without resorting to patching system components or conducting non-portable hacks.

\subsection{Improving Security through Cryptography}

RFC~2595~\cite{rfc2595} deals with best practices for establishing SSL/TLS connections to the IMAP server.  Trojit치
follows these recommendations, most notably it tries to establish a secure channel over {\tt STARTTLS} command even
without an explicit action on the user's side, should the server be configured to advertise itself as not accepting
logins over insecure connections through the {\tt LOGINDISABLED} capability.  A manual override is available in
situations where the SSL encryption is not available.

In advent of the recent breaches of many well-known (and widely trusted) Certificate Authorities~\cite{ssl-breaches},
Trojit치 also comes with support for SSL key pinning~\cite{ssl-pinning}.  The trust model presented to the user is
similar to handling of SSH servers' public keys with OpenSSH -- upon first connection, the user is always presented with
a choice of whether to accept the certificate or not, along with a confirmation about whether the operating system and
its policy considers the certificate as ``trusted''.  No matter what the systemwide policy says, a changed public key is
always considered a threat and the situation is presented to the user accordingly.
