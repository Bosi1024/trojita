"""A client to an IMAP server

You usually have one IMAPClient for each IMAP server you want to access. When
creating, you pass it all the shiny details like how to authenticate to this
server, what capabilities to ban etc, how many connections per server/mailbox
you can afford etc. IMAPClient is clever enough to maintain a pool of existing
IMAPParsers and work with them.

Or, at least, should be when it's done :)


* Mailbox specification:

Several methods expects a specification of mailbox which you want to oeprate
with. As IMAP supports nested mailboxes and their textual representation can
contain multiple differring delimiters, we don't accept an IMAP name, but rather
a tuple/list specifying the "path" to mailbox, this: ("foo", "bar", "baz") can
be translated to, say, "foo.bar/baz".

FIXME: is that really required?
